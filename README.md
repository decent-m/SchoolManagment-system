Welcome to the repository for the School Management System!

My web-based application is designed to help streamline and automate various administrative and academic tasks within your school. My system is accessible by teachers, students, and administrators, and provides a range of features to help manage daily operations.

With my School Management System, you can manage student enrollment, attendance, grades, and transcripts. You can also manage staff, including teacher assignments and schedules, payroll, and performance evaluations.

In addition, my system provides a range of academic tools, such as class scheduling, lesson planning, and curriculum management. It also provides features for communication and collaboration, such as email, messaging, and file sharing.

My School Management System is built on reliable and modern technologies, including PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript. It is also designed to be highly customizable, with options to tailor the system to your school's specific needs.
